## Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS

## AI / Automation Idea
The app includes an AI-inspired symptom detection feature:
- User-entered symptoms are scanned for common keywords (fever, cough, headache, chest pain, etc.).
- Based on detected keywords, the app generates an automatic summary and basic guidance.
- This simulates an AI healthcare assistant using simple rule-based logic (no external AI API).

## NGO Use Case
- Helps NGOs collect patient support requests digitally.
- Provides quick symptom summaries for faster triage.
- Reduces manual effort for volunteers.
- Works well on mobile devices.

## Note
This project is built at a concept level to demonstrate clarity of thought, frontend skills, and basic automation logic.
