# HealPath NGO - Mini Healthcare Support Web App

## Project Purpose
HealPath is a concept-level medical support portal designed for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Its primary goal is to provide a bridge between underprivileged communities and volunteer medical professionals. By offering a digital intake form, the app streamlines the triage process for health concerns in areas with limited medical access.

## Tech Stack Used
- **React **: Chosen for its robust state management and component-based architecture, ensuring the app is scalable and maintainable.
- **TypeScript**: Used to ensure type safety, particularly for handling patient data and symptom mapping.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for a clean, modern, and professional aesthetic that feels trustworthy for a healthcare environment.
- **FontAwesome**: Used for intuitive iconography that enhances user accessibility.

## AI Automation Idea
The app features a "Smart Detection" system (mocked for this concept). 
- **Mechanism**: The system scans the "Symptoms" input field in real-time for specific clinical keywords (e.g., *fever*, *chest pain*, *cough*).
- **Benefit**: It provides immediate, contextualized feedback to the patient. For example, if "chest pain" is detected, the UI instantly warns the user that this could be critical and suggests emergency action. This helps filter cases and provides immediate peace of mind or urgency when most needed.

## How this helps an NGO
1. **Resource Prioritization**: By automatically tagging symptoms, the NGO can sort incoming requests by severity, ensuring emergency cases aren't buried under minor queries.
2. **Data Collection**: It creates a structured digital record of community health trends without requiring expensive custom software.
3. **Accessibility**: The mobile-responsive design ensures that people with limited technology (primarily smartphones) can easily access support from anywhere.
4. **Professionalism**: A modern, clean interface builds trust with both patients and potential donors/volunteers.
